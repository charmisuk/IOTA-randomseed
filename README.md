# IOTA-randomseed

This is simple IOTA seed generator. 

only letters from A-Z and 9's are allowed for the creation of IOTA seed

Either clone it or just copy the python text since it is not even 20 lines long.

If your computer does not have python installed, use online compiler service such as :

However, this practice is not recommended for creating secure keys that hold large bulk of IOTA. 

Use at your own risk. (Just use IDLE)
